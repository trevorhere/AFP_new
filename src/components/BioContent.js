const KenBio = `
​​Kenneth Perry retired from federal service in 2019 with 35 years with both the U.S. Forest
Service and the Bureau of Land Management, in both ground and aviation operations. Kenneth
started his fire career with Kern County Fire Department in 1985 as a seasonal engine crew-
member. In 1988, he won a position working for the USFS with the Fulton Hotshots on the
Sequoia National Forest, and by 1992 he had become a squad leader.
In 1993 Kenneth joined the BLM Smokejumpers, based in Fairbanks Alaska, and during the
next 8 years, Kenneth acquired ground qualifications up to Division/Group Supervisor and
Incident Commander III. Kenneth also served in R&D as an FAA senior parachute rigger and
test jumper.
The majority of Kenneth’s career was spent in tactical aviation operations. He was qualified as
an Air Tactical Group Supervisor in 1998 at a time when a paradigm shift was beginning within
the BLM aerial supervision program, based on the Tactical Aerial Resource Management
(TARM) study that ultimately recommended the development and implementation of the Aerial
Supervision Module (ASM) program. That put Kenneth in position to be part of the development
group; refining crew roles and responsibilities, SOPS and policy. In 2001, Kenneth hired into an
ATS (ASM) position with the BLM National Aviation Office, based in Southern California. This
allowed me to continue to develop the BLM’s ASM program, as well as the USFS’ program that
was beginning to be looked at as a program.
This position led to the opportunity to mentor and instruct at the National Aerial Supervision
Academy (NASA), the California Aerial Supervision academy (CASA) and the National Aerial
Firefighter Academy (NAFA) as a lecturer, Simulator Supervisor and mission flight evaluator.
